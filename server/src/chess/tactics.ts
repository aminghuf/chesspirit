// Tactic puzzles — the "Puzzles" tab of the Train page. Unlike the Tactic
// Trainer (puzzles from your own mistakes, routes/train.ts) these are puzzles
// from the Lichess puzzle database (CC0) that ship with Chesspirit: a few thousand
// popular, often-played ones spread over the whole rating range
// (chess/tacticsSet.json, made by scripts/build-tactics-set.mjs — see there).
//
// Each profile has a puzzle rating (Glicko-1, the same maths as the game
// ratings). A puzzle counts as a game against its own Lichess rating; only the
// first try at a puzzle is rated, and the next puzzle is picked close to your
// rating from the ones you haven't tried yet.
